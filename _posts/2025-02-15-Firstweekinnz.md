#### **Day 1**

2023 Aug 15 marked the first day of me entering the New Zealand territory through the Auckland Airport activating my Working Holiday Visa. Exciting enough, I carried with me a 24 kg large luggage and a 12 kg camping backpack (with my Laptop and tech accessories). The flight time was very nice – departed at around 5pm from Hong Kong, arriving Auckland at 8 am. My boyfriend’s friend residing in Auckland was kind enough to pick us up from the airport to our hotel. 

We booked a week stay at Nesuto Stadium near the CBD, the stay was perfect but yet a little bit pricey and we were not able to cook our own meals. Gratefully, the hotel offered us to have an early check-in at around 11 am. We had plenty of rest and went out for a minor town exploration before the sun set. It was pretty cold, feels like the coldest days in Hong Kong, but heard that it was already a ‘warm day’ in Auckland. Hope I could get through the winter season next year! 

Had our first meal at [1947 eatery](https://1947eatery.co.nz/?gclid=CjwKCAjwpJWoBhA8EiwAHZFzfoB6eggVaytYvD5h7Y-Sy91H3U9k414bdGQ02uzQQeG1r_PwA5zSFBoCw3YQAvD_BwE), ordered some butter chicken with rice and naan, it was very good and made our tummy warm! After dinner, we hung around and check out places like the Sky tower. With our tummy fully filled, we get back to the hotel for a good night sleep. 

#### **Day 2**

We requested an address proof letter from our hotel which was essential in creating a bank account in New Zealand. Without doing enough research, we stormed in a BNZ branch located in the Queen Street requesting for the creation. The bank teller informed us that it is compulsory to have an online booking/ application done through the website for initial screening before further processing. I filled in the form during lunch and submitted at 1:08 PM, and at around 4:10 pm I received reply for requiring me to visit their branch to confirm my identify. 

After lunch, we started exploring the CBD on our feet (aka our fav low cost activity), setting our goal as Mount Eden. 

- University of Auckland
- Mount Eden
- FIFA WWC Semi Final (Spanish VS Denmark) at Eden Park; It was such a great luck and coincidence to be able join the game without much early research (again..). We bought the cheapest category tickets near the cage (?). Turned out we watched the team (Spain) who gained the champion title of the WWC!

#### **Day 3**

First thing of the day was going to the BNZ branch for identity verification in creating the bank account. The process was smooth, just a simple check on the passport documents. The staff guided us to use the mobile app and assisted in the set up. The whole process was fast and we got a ETPOS card which is ready to use right away. For Debit Card, it took around a week to mail to us. (We used the hotel as the postal address). After lunch, we went back to the hotel for starting my remote work duty.
